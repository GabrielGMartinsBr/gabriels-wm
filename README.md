![GitHub license](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)


## Overview

GabrielsWM is a personal project aimed at building a minimalistic and lightweight window manager for the X Window System (X11) in Linux. The project is currently under development and serves as a learning platform to gain a deeper understanding of C++, Xorg, and low-level programming.


## Project Status

ðŸš§ **Work in Progress**: GabrielsWM is currently under active development. Some features may not be fully implemented or stable yet. Contributions and feedback are welcome!


## Features

- [x] Basic window management and manipulation
- [x] Interaction with external libraries like Cairo for improved graphics
- [ ] Minimalistic and customizable user interface


## Motivation

As a web developer with a passion for software development and a desire to expand my skills, I embarked on the journey of building GabrielsWM. This project serves as an opportunity to explore the intricacies of low-level programming, Linux desktop environments, and X11 window management.


## Goals

The main objectives of GabrielsWM are:

- Deepen C++ expertise and explore modern C++ standards
- Gain insights into Linux desktop environments and X11 protocol
- Understand low-level programming concepts and system-level interactions
- Integrate external libraries for enhanced graphics rendering
- Develop a minimalistic and lightweight window manager with a customizable user interface


## Build Instructions

To build GabrielsWM, you need to have CMake and the required dependencies installed on your system (e.g., X11 and Cairo libraries). Follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
